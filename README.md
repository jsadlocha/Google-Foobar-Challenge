# Google-Foobar-Challenge
My solutions for Google's FooBar.

While working on hacking kernel, the Google page slanted and an inscription appeared `You're speaking our language. Up for a challenge?` and i got secret invitations.

I learned a lot during these challenges and i post my solutions here.

##### I implemented algorithms like:
- Absorbing markov chain
- Maximum bipartite matching

And other interesting problems (actually 10+ challenges, because some bonus problems)

But recently i got new invitations and i solve this time in java.
